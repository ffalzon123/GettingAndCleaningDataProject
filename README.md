## GettingAndCleaningDataProject
These are the files for my Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project

- CodeBook.Rmd - This contains the steps to transform the data and the file specifications of the tidy data set SummarizedHARData.txt

- run_analysis.R - This is the script used to transform UCI HAR Dataset. This script needs to be run from within the "UCI HAR Dataset",
and it produces the tidy data set SummarizedHARData.txt

- SummarizedHARData.txt - This is the resultant data set
